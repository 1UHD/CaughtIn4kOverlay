Upcoming Minecraft Hypixel Stats Overlay made using Electron.js for Windows, MacOS and Linux

In case you want to test the code before the overlay even properly works:
1. clone this repository
2. install nodejs if neccessary
3. cd into the directory
4. run npm install electron to install electron
5. start up the project by using npm test
6. put in your api key in src/stats.js
7. enjoy I guess

PS: please dont use my api key in case I forgot to remove it before pushing
